# -> all rebirth above apply for Muscle legend Rock ( x ) 
## How the glitch work?
- each level increases exp by 1250 for unique pets ( orange theme pets) : DarkStar, Golden Warrior, Cyber, Flaming Hedgehog, Elec Bunny...etc
- best pets for rebirth are Darkstar, Cyber, flaming hedgehog,elec bunny
->The rest is not recommend since it can disappear after u rebirth for a while

- Level 1 1250 ; level 2 2500; level 3 3750l level 4 5000.... ; level 20
- -> exp = 1250 x level
## how to be able to glitch at any rebirth

- Glitch is obtained by putting pets at the limit of exp
- Multiple of exp  = (rebirth + 20) *  Rock value
            -> what does it mean : at 30 rebirth, you can get 625 exp on muscle legends rock, 125 exp on legends rock
 # how to calculate?
  | Rock                 | Value |
| -------------------- | ----- |
| Tiny Rock            | 0.025 |
| Punching Rock        | 0.05  |
| Large Rock           | 0.075 |
| Golden Rock          | 0.2   |
| Frozen Rock          | 0.375 |
| Mystic Rock          | 0.75  |
| Inferno Rock         | 1.125 |
| Rock of Legends      | 2.5   |
| Muscle King Mountain | 12.5  |
-> For muscle king rock you have ( 30 + 20 ) x 12.5 = 625
      legends rock you have      ( 30 + 20 ) x 2.5 = 125
 How to make a pet glitchable (simple)
Punch rock → get EXP
Check next level EXP limit
Add EXP until the pet reaches the level limit
When EXP is exactly at the limit → glitch works
  # level 1 has 1250, you make 625 exp then you have a blanket about 1250 - 625 exp = 625 exp
  - -> all you need to do is add 625 exp for the pet so that you can glitch
    ## Example
 - which apply for higher rebirth
  - 15000 rebirths = (15000 + 20 ) * 12.5 = 187,500
  - which you need to calculate exp so the exp total of level < 187,500
1250 + 2500 + 3750 + 5000 + .... < 187,500
    | Level | EXP cần | EXP còn    |
| ----- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1     | 1,250   | 186,500    |
| 2     | 2,500   | 184,000    |
| 3     | 3,750   | 180,250    |
| 4     | 5,000   | 175,250    |
| 5     | 6,250   | 169,000    |
| 6     | 7,500   | 161,500    |
| 7     | 8,750   | 152,750    |
| 8     | 10,000  | 142,750    |
| 9     | 11,250  | 131,500    |
| 10    | 12,500  | 119,000    |
| 11    | 13,750  | 105,250    |
| 12    | 15,000  | 90,250     |
| 13    | 16,250  | 74,000     |
| 14    | 17,500  | 56,500     |
| 15    | 18,750  | 37,750     |
| 16    | 20,000  | 17,750     |
| 17    | 21,250  | not enough |

->  you will reach level 16 17,750 exp after punch 
# so if you want to get it glitchable, you will need the exp = limit of the next level which mean
- you will need exp = max of lvl 17 = 21250
-> so you will need to add 21,250 - 17,750 = 3500
 -> note the exp need to add = 3500
- now add it to the pet <=> add 3500 exp to pet before u glitch or else u can't
- As we know lvl has 1250 exp => 3500 - 1250 = 2250 -> +1 lvl = lvl 2
- 2250 < 2500 -> we have to make the exp of pet 2250 and at level 2
- so that you can glitch
  All calculations assume Muscle King Mountain

# Other rocks can be converted by:
- EXP_other = EXP_muscle / rock value
- Glitch success depends on exact EXP alignment
- Small EXP mismatch = glitch fails
